# Stage-0 Honeypot Demo (Work in Progress)

This is a local, simulated honeypot project (Stage-0).  
It generates decoy files, simulates login attempts, and summarizes the logs.  
No real network or attacker data is used — safe to run locally.  
Run the scripts in order: `make_decoys.py`, `simulate_attacks.py`, `summarize_clean.py`.  
**Note:** This is a work-in-progress — future stages will include VM-based honeypots and AI-based analysis.
